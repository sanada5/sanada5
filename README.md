## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I hold a master's degree in Statistics from ETH ZÃ¼rich and a bachelor degree in Mathematics from Jacobs University Bremen. I recently concluded my master thesis where I analytically compared the performance of deep learning models (Vanilla recurrent neural network, Long short-term memory network, Temporal convolutional neural network and Transformer) to that of statistical models (AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA) in the one-step ahead forecasting of univariate synthetic and real time series. 

I am deeply passionate about Data Science, and my diverse practical experiences have allowed me to explore different facets of the field. For instance:
	â€¢	During my last internship, I developed a confidence estimator pipeline in Python, integrating feature engineering, data preprocessing, model fitting, and model calibration.
	â€¢	At the Swiss Data Science Center, I contributed to a project by implementing a data preprocessing pipeline for a graph database of Swiss parliamentary longitudinal data, using Python, Cypher, Neo4j, and text preprocessing tools.
	â€¢	At the Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t Research Center for Mathematics of Data, I designed a framework of physics-informed neural networks to solve forward and inverse PDE problems by augmenting the loss function to balance prediction accuracy with physical constraints.

In addition, my experience as a Teaching Assistant at both ETH ZÃ¼rich and Jacobs University Bremen strengthened my communication and presentation skillsâ€”essential soft skills that I consider vital for building a successful career in Data Science, which I aspire to pursue.
